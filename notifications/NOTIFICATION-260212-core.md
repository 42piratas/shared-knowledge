# Core Infrastructure Maintenance

Start: 2026-02-12 06:30 UTC

Hello,

During the above window, our Engineering team will be performing maintenance on core control plane infrastructure in all regions. Please note that the existing infrastructure will continue running without issue.

We do not anticipate any impact; however, there is a small possibility that control panel functionality specifically CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations may be affected during the maintenance window. All running workloads are expected to continue operating normally without interruption.

Our team will be actively monitoring the environment throughout the maintenance, and any unexpected events will be promptly communicated through our status page.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this maintenance, please feel free to open a support ticket from within your account. We’re here to help.

Thank you,
Team DigitalOcean
